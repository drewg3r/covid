<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Website Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/drewg3r/covid)

There are a lot of information sources for COVID-19 stats in Ukraine. But all of them have overloaded interface with lots of useless information(or the interface consists of lots of graphic so its hard to view on mobile or with pure internet connection). So I decided to create a very simple webpage showing only information that matters(for me and, hopefully, for others). 

This is my first experience working with JS. I just wanted to learn basics of it so I haven't used even jQuery.
